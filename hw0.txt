# Description of your program (part 7)
Take input file path from user

Check to see if path exists. If does not throw an error informing the user of invalid input

If it does exists, open the file.

Declare a variable representing the word count

Declare a variable representing the current character being scanned

While the character is whitespace, move on to the next character in the document

When it is not whitespace increment the count by one

While the character is not whitespace do nothing until it is whitespace

Repeat this loop until there are no more characters in the process

Output the count

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)

As a student with some programming experience, this excercise was harder than I expected it to be. I actually found
describing programming instructions in English harder than typing them out as code. So I wrote a basic program in code
in order to understand how to describe it English. Overall it was a satisfying assignment

I'd like to get comfortable coding in Python through this course as it is a new programming paradigm for me. I would
also like to work on a project of my choosing in Python that I can add to my portfolio.
